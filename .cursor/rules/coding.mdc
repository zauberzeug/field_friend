# Coding Guidelines for AI Assistants

**Primary Reference**: @CONTRIBUTING.md

## AI-Specific Notes

- Never overwrite .env files without explicit confirmation
- When making changes, always check for existing similar functionality in the codebase to avoid duplication
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless absolutely necessary
- For files over 200-300 lines, suggest refactoring opportunities
- When fixing bugs, exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns
- Don't repeat yourself:
    - Do not add comments for obvious things. The code is the documentation. Only subtle or very complicated lines should have comments and start with "NOTE: "
    - Test functions should not have docstrings; it's much better to find a descriptive function name.
